# AlexNet-Image-Classification

AlexNet is a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture developed by Alex Krizhevsky, Ilya Sutskever, and Geoffrey Hinton in 2012. It is considered a breakthrough in the field of computer vision and deep learning, as it was the first CNN to win the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge (ILSVRC) in 2012, significantly outperforming traditional computer vision methods.

The architecture of AlexNet consists of eight layers, including five convolutional layers, two fully connected layers, and one softmax output layer. The network has a total of 60 million parameters and was trained on a dataset of 1.2 million images from 1,000 different classes.

AlexNet introduced several key innovations in CNN architecture, including the use of Rectified Linear Units (ReLU) activation functions, overlapping pooling, and data augmentation techniques such as image flipping and cropping. These techniques helped to reduce overfitting and improve the generalization performance of the network.

The success of AlexNet marked a major milestone in the development of deep learning and demonstrated the power of CNNs in computer vision tasks. It paved the way for the development of more complex and powerful CNN architectures, such as VGGNet, GoogLeNet, and ResNet.
