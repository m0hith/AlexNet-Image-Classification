# AlexNet-Image-Classification

AlexNet is a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture developed by Alex Krizhevsky, Ilya Sutskever, and Geoffrey Hinton in 2012. It is considered a breakthrough in the field of computer vision and deep learning, as it was the first CNN to win the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge (ILSVRC) in 2012, significantly outperforming traditional computer vision methods.

The architecture of AlexNet consists of eight layers, including five convolutional layers, two fully connected layers, and one softmax output layer. The network has a total of 60 million parameters and was trained on a dataset of 1.2 million images from 1,000 different classes.

AlexNet introduced several key innovations in CNN architecture, including the use of Rectified Linear Units (ReLU) activation functions, overlapping pooling, and data augmentation techniques such as image flipping and cropping. These techniques helped to reduce overfitting and improve the generalization performance of the network.

The success of AlexNet marked a major milestone in the development of deep learning and demonstrated the power of CNNs in computer vision tasks. It paved the way for the development of more complex and powerful CNN architectures, such as VGGNet, GoogLeNet, and ResNet.

### Dataset:
CIFAR-10 is a dataset of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class. The classes are: airplane, automobile, bird, cat, deer, dog, frog, horse, ship, and truck.

The CIFAR-10 dataset is commonly used as a benchmark for image classification tasks, particularly in the context of deep learning. It is a challenging dataset due to its small image size and the presence of class overlap, which means that some images can be difficult to classify accurately.

CIFAR-10 is often used for training and evaluating deep learning models such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and has been used as a basis for a number of research papers in the field of computer vision. The small size of the images in the dataset means that models trained on CIFAR-10 can be trained relatively quickly, which makes it a useful resource for researchers who need to experiment with different model architectures and hyperparameters.
